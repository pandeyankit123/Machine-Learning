<h3>1. Linear regression</h3>
<p>
    . Dated: 23 September 2022 <br>
    . Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) through the data points, allowing us to make predictions or understand the correlation between the variables. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, making it a simple yet powerful tool for understanding and predicting numerical outcomes in various fields, such as economics, finance, and machine learning. <br>

<h3>2. Logistic regression</h3>
<p>
    . Dated: 02 October 2022 <br>
    . Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts the probability of an event occurring based on input features. The output of logistic regression is a value between 0 and 1, which represents the probability of the input belonging to one of the two classes. It is widely used in various fields, such as machine learning, statistics, and data science, for tasks like spam detection, medical diagnosis, and risk assessment. <br>
